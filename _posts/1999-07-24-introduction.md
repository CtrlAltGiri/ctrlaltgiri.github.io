I'm *Giridhar Balachandran*.

Born in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. Started coding when I was 12. Built my first website at that age. Won several coding competitions in school.

Went to Manipal Institute of Technology for undergrad. Learned the fundamentals. Built more things.

Joined Microsoft after graduation. Worked on Data Loss Prevention systems. Built things at scale. Learned what enterprise software really means.

Then moved to Zamp. A fintech company. Built AI agents for enterprise finance. Worked with Uber and DoorDash. Made their financial operations smarter.

Now I'm at Cornell. Studying computer science. Wanted to be closer to San Francisco. The tech capital.

I build AI systems. I solve problems at scale. I'm interested in the intersection of finance and technology.

That's it.
